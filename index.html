	<h1>Hello World</h1>
	<h3>So, I heard you were thinking of building something? This website was created to advise you on which first steps to take in your journey, depending on what exactly you want to build. It's essentially like having an experienced mentor there with you. However, this way, you don't need to take up someone else's time.</h3>
